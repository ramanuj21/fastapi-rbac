## ✅ RBAC Implementation Progress (NIST-aligned)

### Completed

- ✅ Core RBAC (Users, Roles, Permissions, Assignments)
- ✅ Hierarchical RBAC (Role inheritance, Cycle detection)
- ✅ Static Separation of Duty (SSD)
  - Constraint definition
  - Assignment enforcement
  - API support and tests
- ✅ In-memory storage backend
- ✅ FastAPI endpoints
- ✅ Test suite with coverage (~90%+)
- ✅ Dockerized setup using pyproject.toml

### Pending

- 🔁 Dynamic Separation of Duty (DSD)
  - Session-based role activation
  - DSD constraint management (API, validation, tests)
- 🧰 Optional Enhancements
  - Role/Permission revocation
  - List APIs (users, roles, permissions)
  - Persistent DB backend (SQLAlchemy)
  - Multi-tenant RBAC (for shaalaa.online)
  - Admin tools for import/export

# ✅ RBAC Project Checklist

## 🔹 Core Features
- [x] Create Users
- [x] Create Roles
- [x] Create Permissions
- [x] Assign Roles to Users
- [x] Grant Permissions to Roles
- [x] Role Hierarchy (with cycle detection)
- [x] Check if User has a Permission
- [x] List User’s Permissions
- [x] List Roles assigned to a User

## 🔹 SSD (Static Separation of Duty)
- [x] Add SSD Constraints (Conflict Sets)
- [x] Validate SSD Constraints on Role Assignment
- [x] Pluggable SSD Storage (e.g., InMemory)
- [x] CRUD APIs for managing SSD rules
- [x] Unit Tests for SSD

## 🔹 DSD (Dynamic Separation of Duty)
- [x] Add DSD Constraints (Conflict Sets)
- [x] Create Sessions with Role Activations
- [x] Validate DSD Constraints on Session Creation
- [x] Pluggable DSD Storage (e.g., InMemory)
- [x] CRUD APIs for managing DSD rules
- [x] Unit Tests for DSD

## 🔹 API & DevOps
- [x] FastAPI integration with endpoints
- [x] Swagger/OpenAPI docs (`/docs`)
- [x] Dockerfile to build app
- [x] Makefile with:
  - [x] `build`
  - [x] `run`
  - [x] `test`
  - [x] `install`
  - [x] `lock`
- [x] HTML Coverage report mount in Docker

## 🔹 Test Coverage
- [x] Unit tests for all happy paths
- [x] Tests for error paths (missing users/roles/permissions)
- [x] SSD violations
- [x] DSD violations
- [x] Cycle detection in hierarchy
- [ ] 🔲 100% test coverage goal (track `htmlcov/index.html`)

## 🔹 Future Improvements
- [ ] Persistent Storage (PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy)
- [ ] REST Admin APIs:
  - [ ] Remove user/role/permission
  - [ ] Edit SSD/DSD sets
  - [ ] View all users/roles/permissions
- [ ] Multitenancy support
- [ ] Admin Dashboard (HTML/JS frontend or Swagger enhancements)
- [ ] Role-based API access enforcement example
- [ ] Session expiry or token integration
